# GTM Custom Variable Template â€“ Get GA4 Client ID & Session Info (via API)

This is a custom variable template for Google Tag Manager that safely retrieves the **GA4 Client ID**, **Session ID**, or **Session Number** using the native `readAnalyticsStorage` API.

---

## What this template does

With this variable, you can:
- Get the **GA4 Client ID** for user-level identification.
- Access the **Session ID** or **Session Number** tied to a specific GA4 Measurement ID.
- Use this data for custom events, server-side tagging, or debugging.

> Requires `analytics_storage` to be available (e.g., user has granted consent via Consent Mode).

2. **Select** the value you want to return:
   - `Client ID`
   - `Session ID`
   - `Session Number`
3. If you choose a session-based value, **enter your GA4 Measurement ID** (e.g. `G-XXXXXXX`).
4. **Use the variable** in your tags or scripts, for example:
   - Sending enriched data via Measurement Protocol
   - Debugging session/user attribution
